ServerManager is a Windows Asp.Net MVC4 project that indent to ease the life of [Windows] Servers Administrators.
Maybe in later version it will allow to open shell command to some linux machine too, but it is not it's main purpose at the moment.

The initial goal is to provide a simple single interface for every servers on a network, and to allow start/shutdown on one click.
There is an initial configuration process in which you just need to add server information and well... you'll be ready to go.

#todo#
-Full Async operation for JS enabled browsers, keep the "classics" one for the others (well a Enhanced security mode for IE disable JS so it's important to keep it in good shape.)
-Add powershell CLI for target server
-Add more information about server when powered on like
	-CPU status
	-RAM status
	-NIC usage
	-HDD usage
-Add visual entry, to make a cool UI
-Improve ease of access on smartphone, touchscreen and tablet in general.
-don't store as cleartext the session password.

#Changelog#
