ServerManager is a Windows Asp.Net MVC4 project that indent to ease the life of [Windows] Servers Administrators.
Maybe in later version it will allow to open shell command to some linux machine too, but it is not it's main purpose at the moment.

The initial goal is to provide a simple single interface for every servers on a network, and to allow start/shutdown on one click.
There is an initial configuration process in which you just need to add server information and well... you'll be ready to go.

#todo#
-add custom jQuery validation, for MAC Address for example.
-Full Async operation for JS enabled browsers, keep the "classics" one for the others (well a Enhanced security mode for IE disable JS so it's important to keep it in good shape.)
-Add powershell CLI for target server
-Add more information about server when powered on like
	-CPU status
	-RAM status
	-NIC usage
	-HDD usage
-Add visual entry, to make a cool UI
-Improve ease of access on smartphone, touchscreen and tablet in general.
-don't store as cleartext the session password.

#Changelog#
v0.3: added support in which we find the ip Address of the server thanks to arp command and the mac address. Helpfull to detect the ip address dynamically and know if server is running or not.
v0.2c: cleanup of js code in preference screen, multiserver add support on UI return, cleanup of add function (still js side).
v0.2b: jQuery debug on preference, now fully update the edit/list row when 1 server is added. Some debug on multiserver added might be needed AND multiserver added on list row update support is needed.
v0.2a: intensive jQuery usage in preference screen for a more UI friendly page. Some parts still need some debugging...
	Beginning of AJAXing requests, still in preference screen yes.
	already deprecated ServerRUD.cshtml page, was maybe a bad practice, to segmentated code for now... will see later if needed or not.
v0.1: Startup of project with original goal: being able to startup/shutdown some windows (computers) servers inside a network from a single interface.
	GPL Licensing for Github.
